# TDD Bowling

I completed this project as part of my study at [Enspiral Dev Academy](https://devacademy.co.nz/).

Given an array of frames for a single player, [game.js](/game.js) will calculate the total game score for the player.

The main aim of this was to help us become familiar with test-driven development (TDD) while working on our JavaScript skills.

## Tests:

- Initial test setup (Jest is working)
- Gutterball frames
- Normal frames
- Spare frames
- Single strike frames
- Double strike frames
- Full game of 10 frames, excluding if the 10th frame has a strike or spare in it
- Full game of 10 frames, including special conditions in the 10th frame
